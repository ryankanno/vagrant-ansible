Vagrant-Ansible
===============

Nothing to see here.  This is just my vagrant configuration setup to test
[ansible playbooks](https://github.com/ryankanno/playbooks/).

Installation
============

Make sure to create a symlink (provisioning/playbook.yml) to the playbook 
you want to test.

`ln -s <playbook_you_want_to_test> provisioning/playbook.yml`
